# The-paradox-of-birthdays
The birthday paradox, also known as the birthday problem, is the surprisingly high probability that two people have the same birthday, even in a relatively small group of people. In a group of 70 people, the probability that two people have the same birthday is 99.9%. However, already in a group of 23 people, the probability of birthdays matching is 50%. The above program performs several probability experiments to determine the percentages for groups of different sizes. Such experiments, based on modeling possible outcomes through many random trials, are called Monte Carlo experiments.
